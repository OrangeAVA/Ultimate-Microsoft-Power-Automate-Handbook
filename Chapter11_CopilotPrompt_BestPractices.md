# Copilot Prompt Engineering Best Practices

## Context
Improve Copilot's output by crafting clear, specific prompts.

## Best Practices
- Be specific: Include list/library/table names, field names, recipients, and thresholds.
- Start with the outcome: State the business goal first, then details.
- Use technical terms: Reference Power Automate actions and connectors.
- Describe business rules: Clearly articulate logic and conditions.
- Iterate: Refine Copilot's output with follow-up prompts.

## Example
"Create a flow that sends vacation requests from a SharePoint list called 'Time Off Requests' to the requester's manager for approval, updates the status field after approval or rejection, and notifies the requester via email."
