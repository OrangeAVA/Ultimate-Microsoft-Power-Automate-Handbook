Identity: System-assigned
Permissions: Least privilege required
Scope: Specific resources only
```

**2. Credential Rotation Schedule**
```
Service Account Passwords: Every 90 days
API Keys: Every 180 days
OAuth Tokens: Auto-refresh enabled
Certificate-based Auth: Annual renewal
```

**3. Access Control**
```yaml
Connection Ownership: Service accounts
Sharing: Disabled by default
Approved Users: Documented list
Review Frequency: Quarterly
```

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Policy

**Connector Classification:**

**Business Data Group:**
- SharePoint
- OneDrive
- Exchange
- Teams
- Planner

**Non-Business Data Group:**
- Twitter
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Consumer Gmail

**Blocked Connectors:**
- File system operations
- Desktop flows (in production)
- HTTP connectors (without approval)

**Policy Enforcement:**
```
Rule: Business connectors cannot be used with non-business connectors in same flow

## Performance Optimization

### Pagination Implementation

**For Large Datasets:**
```yaml
Action: List items (SharePoint)
Settings:
  Top Count: 5000  # Maximum per request
  Pagination:
    Enable: Yes
    Threshold: 100000  # Total items to retrieve
```

**Processing Pattern:**
```
Do Until: No more items
â”œâ”€ Get items (top 5000)
â”œâ”€ Process batch
â”œâ”€ Update cursor/skip token
â””â”€ Check for more items
```

### Batch Operations

**Example: Update Multiple Records**
```yaml
Instead of: Loop through items, update one by one
Use: Batch update API

Batch Configuration:
  Items per batch: 100
  Parallel batches: 5
  Retry on failure: Yes
  Error handling: Continue on partial failure
```

### Caching Strategy

**Implement for:**
- Reference data that changes infrequently
- Lookup tables
- Configuration settings
- User profiles

**Cache Location Options:**
- SharePoint list (simple)
- Azure Table Storage (scalable)
- Flow variables (session-only)

  3. If issues found:
     - Log to monitoring list
     - Alert admin team
     - Create service ticket
```

### Usage Analytics

**Track Metrics:**
```
- Runs per connector per day
- Success rate by connector
- Average execution time
- Error frequency and types
- Peak usage times
- Cost per connector (premium)
```

**Dashboard Elements:**
- Connector health status
- Run history trends
- Error rate charts
- Performance metrics
- Cost analysis

## Notes

- All connector configurations shown are examples and should be customized
- Premium connectors require appropriate licensing
- Custom connector development requires API knowledge
- Security policies should be reviewed with IT/Security teams
- Monitor connector usage for optimization opportunities
- Keep connector credentials secure and rotated regularly
- Test thoroughly in non-production environments first
